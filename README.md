# The Self-Programmer

The self-programmer is an app of apps.

It's agent-centric, and decentralized.

To participate you just have to trust someone.

It runs standalone, and as a federated web server.

Any participant can modify and control the self-programmer.

It's made with Deno and released on the public domain.

For more information contact the maintainers.

Every app can run in the self-programmer.
